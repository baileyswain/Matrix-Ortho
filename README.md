# Matrix-Ortho

Bailey Swain 
In order to complete this assignment in a more efficient way than I did Homework #2 I began the program by defining a handful of functions that would make it all more streamlined. I added in an error checking aspect by using a while loop. In order to do this I had to set an empty vector to hold the corrected vectors, empty vectors, scalar and g_pred to be accessed for the current iteration. Than if the error was greater than the threshold it was appended to the A matrix, (overall connectivity matrix). In this scenario as the threshold decreases the time it takes to converge grows. regardless there is variation between runs likely due to the randomness. If the pair are somewhat close in size it lowers the amount of iterations to convergence. Unless the error is less than the threshold set by errorThreshold the loop will continue iterating. When the threshold is less than 1% it could take 1e-06 iterations to converge. When I tried when you use a constant κ value (try κ = 0.1, from 1 - epsilon) the program took an unreasonable amount of time to converge. Matrix orthogonality decreases as dimensionality increases. At some point the program will have a large enough dimensionality that it is completely random. When the error correction algorithm is run with sequentially associated vectors it take an unreasonable amount of time to converge.
